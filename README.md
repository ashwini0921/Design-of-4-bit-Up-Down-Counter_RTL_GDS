# Design-of-4-bit-Up-Down-Counter_RTL_GDS
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a 4-bit Up-Down Counter, starting from RTL description and proceeding all the way to the final GDSII layout, using a complete open-source VLSI toolchain. The objective was to gain hands-on experience with the digital design flow—covering simulation, synthesis, verification, timing analysis, physical design, and layout generation—without relying on proprietary EDA tools.

The counter was first described at the RTL (Register Transfer Level) using Verilog and functionally verified using Icarus Verilog along with waveform inspection in GTKWave. Logic synthesis was carried out using Yosys, which translated the RTL design into a gate-level netlist mapped to standard cells. For Static Timing Analysis (STA), the design was evaluated with OpenSTA to ensure that the counter met the required timing constraints. The physical design flow—including floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, routing, and layout generation—was performed using OpenROAD. Finally, the project concluded with the generation of a valid GDSII file, which represents the final chip layout.

By completing this project, I gained practical exposure to the RTL-to-GDS flow, learned to effectively use open-source EDA tools, and understood the challenges of ensuring functional correctness, timing closure, and design-rule compliance in VLSI design
